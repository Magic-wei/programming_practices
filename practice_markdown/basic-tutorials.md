# Links & Images
Inline links is like this:
[describe of this link to some websites, here is "link to google searching"](www.google.com)
and images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the exact same way. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ). For example:
![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png)

# Blockquotes
To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>). For example:
> "In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and, picking a pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down the slope of the breakwater."

# Lists
This tutorial is all about creating lists in Markdown.

There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered. That's a fancy way of saying that there are lists with bullet points, and lists with numbers.

To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. For example, a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

# Paragraphs

If you forcefully insert a new line, you end up breaking the togetherness:

Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

OR you can have a soft break as follows:

Do I contradict myself?··
Very well then I contradict myself,··
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Each dot ( · ) represents a space on the keyboard.
